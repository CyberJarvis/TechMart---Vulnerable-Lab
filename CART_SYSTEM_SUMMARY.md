# Amazon-like Cart System Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Objective Completed
Successfully implemented an Amazon-like shopping cart system with multi-step purchase flow including coupon application during checkout, making vulnerability testing more realistic and user-friendly.

## 🚀 Features Implemented

### 1. Shopping Cart Functionality
- **Add to Cart**: Products can be added to cart with specified quantities
- **View Cart**: Dedicated cart page showing all items, quantities, and totals
- **Remove from Cart**: Items can be removed from the shopping cart
- **Stock Validation**: Real-time stock checking and availability display

### 2. Checkout Process
- **Checkout Page**: Dedicated checkout page with order summary
- **Coupon Application**: Apply coupon codes during checkout (maintains vulnerability)
- **Wallet Integration**: Shows wallet balance and validates sufficient funds
- **Purchase Processing**: Complete multi-item purchase with single transaction

### 3. Enhanced User Experience
- **Navigation**: Cart link in navigation bar with item count badge
- **Product Pages**: Updated with "Add to Cart" buttons instead of direct purchase
- **Amazon-like Flow**: Browse → Add to Cart → View Cart → Checkout → Apply Coupons → Purchase

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### New Routes Added
```python
@app.route('/add_to_cart', methods=['POST'])      # Add items to session cart
@app.route('/cart')                               # View cart contents  
@app.route('/remove_from_cart/<product_id>')     # Remove items from cart
@app.route('/checkout', methods=['GET', 'POST']) # Checkout page with coupons
# Modified /purchase route to handle cart-based purchases
```

### Templates Created
- **`templates/cart.html`**: Shopping cart interface with item management
- **`templates/checkout.html`**: Checkout page with coupon application
- **Updated `templates/product.html`**: Add to cart functionality
- **Updated `templates/base.html`**: Navigation with cart link and item count

### Database Fixes Applied
- Fixed column name inconsistency (`stock` vs `stock_quantity`)
- Ensured proper stock management during cart-based purchases
- Maintained wallet transaction logging for purchases

## 🎯 Vulnerability Testing Preserved

### Business Logic Flaw (Coupon Abuse)
- **Vulnerability Intact**: MEGA50 coupon can still be applied multiple times
- **Realistic Testing**: Now tested through proper shopping cart flow
- **Enhanced Experience**: Coupon application happens during checkout like real e-commerce

### Testing Results
```
✅ Login successful
✅ Added 2x Laptop to cart  
✅ Added 1x Phone to cart
✅ Cart view successful
✅ Purchase processing working
🚨 Coupon reuse vulnerability confirmed working
```

## 🌐 Access Information
- **Application URL**: http://127.0.0.1:5002
- **Test Script**: `test_cart_system.py`
- **Database**: `vulnerable_shop.db` (compatible)

## 📋 Next Steps Available
1. **Multi-User Testing**: Test cart isolation between different user sessions
2. **Advanced Exploits**: Develop more sophisticated business logic exploits
3. **Cart Persistence**: Implement cart persistence across sessions
4. **Additional Vulnerabilities**: Add cart-specific vulnerabilities (IDOR on cart items, etc.)

## 🎉 Success Metrics
- ✅ Amazon-like shopping experience implemented
- ✅ All existing vulnerabilities preserved  
- ✅ Enhanced realism for security testing
- ✅ Maintains educational value of the lab
- ✅ Cart system fully functional with proper error handling

The implementation successfully transforms the direct-purchase model into a realistic shopping cart experience while preserving all intentional vulnerabilities for security testing and educational purposes.
