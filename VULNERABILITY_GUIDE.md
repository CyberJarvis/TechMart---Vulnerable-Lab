# TechMart - Hidden Vulnerability Guide

## üéØ How to Find Hidden Vulnerabilities

Your TechMart e-commerce platform now looks completely legitimate, but contains hidden vulnerability information accessible through small blue "i" buttons throughout the interface.

### üîç Where to Find Vulnerability Information:

#### 1. **Login Page** - SQL Injection
- Location: `/login`
- Look for: Blue "i" button next to "Customer Login"
- Vulnerability: SQL injection in username/password fields
- Test: Try `admin' OR '1'='1' --` in username field

#### 2. **Product Pages** - XSS & Business Logic
- Location: `/product/1`, `/product/2`, etc.
- Look for: Blue "i" buttons next to "Customer Reviews" and "Add to Cart"
- Vulnerabilities: 
  - Stored XSS in comments
  - Coupon code mass abuse
- Test XSS: Submit comment with `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`
- Test Coupon: Use codes multiple times: `SAVE10`, `WELCOME20`, `MEGA50`

#### 3. **Dashboard** - IDOR & CSRF
- Location: `/dashboard` (requires login)
- Look for: Blue "i" buttons next to "Order History" and "Account Management"
- Vulnerabilities:
  - IDOR in receipt viewing
  - CSRF in password change
- Test IDOR: Change receipt URL numbers `/receipt/1`, `/receipt/2`, etc.

#### 4. **Admin Panel** - Multiple Vulnerabilities
- Location: `/admin` (no authentication required!)
- Look for: Multiple blue "i" buttons throughout admin tools
- Vulnerabilities:
  - Broken access control (no auth check)
  - Command injection in ping tool
  - SSRF in URL checker
  - SSTI in template renderer
  - Directory traversal in file viewer

### üõ°Ô∏è Testing Examples:

**SQL Injection (Login):**
```
Username: admin' OR '1'='1' --
Password: anything
```

**SSRF (URL Checker):**
```
http://localhost:5001/admin
